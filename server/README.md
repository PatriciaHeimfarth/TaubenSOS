This folder contains resources pertaining to the development of the server's back-end, including the RESTful API.

## The Flask/Connexion demo project

The playground folder serves prototyping purposes and already contains a little demo project, which utilizes [Zalando's Connexion framework](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) for building a RESTful web service. Connexion is a Swagger/OpenAPI First framework for Python that runs on top of Flask and provides automatic endpoint validation & OAuth 2.0 support. For an introductory tutorial, take a look at [this](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api/). In order to understand OAuth 2.0, [Medium](https://medium.com/google-cloud/understanding-oauth2-and-building-a-basic-authorization-server-of-your-own-a-beginners-guide-cf7451a16f66) provides a brief and intelligible summary. The Resource Owner Password Credentials authorization flow is discussed [here](https://medium.com/@ratrosy/building-a-basic-authorization-server-using-resource-owner-password-credentials-flow-a666d06900fb). The flask_connexion project uses a Python virtual environment (venv), which may be set to work by following the step-by-step guide below.

## Utilizing plain 'vanilla' Flask w/o Connexion

The Connexion framework doesn't serve our purposes as it lacks in terms of OAuth 2.0 support. The only flow supported is the implicit grant type, which rather suits browser-based client-side web applications than native mobile apps. Being an in-house development, the Android application is a trusted first-party client for sure, which suggests using the resource owner password credentials flow. Due to safety concerns, it is appropriate to let an IDaaS-provider such as Auth0 take care of the authorization server. The [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/backend/python) plays nicely with Python Flask, for a quick tutorial check [this](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/) out. In order to understand how to use Flask with PostgreSQL, take a look at [this](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-with-flask-the-tdd-way). Utilizing SQLAlchemy in combination with Marshmallow is discussed [here](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/build-simple-restful-api-with-python-and-flask-part-2-724ebf04d12) and [here](https://realpython.com/flask-connexion-rest-api-part-2/).

## Setting up your virtual environment

1. Navigate to the respective project's root folder
2. Create a virtual environment named 'env' by typing `python3 -m venv env`
3. Activate that environment by running `source env/bin/activate`
4. Install the packages required by the project with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Deactivate the virtual environment by typing `deactivate`
6. Now you're set up to run the project: `env/bin/python run.py`

## Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk requires you to set up the following environment variables:

* `AWS_DATABASE_URL`: The URL to the PostgreSQL DB
* `AWS_S3_MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME`: The name of the S3 bucket in which the media files shall be stored

For the following environment variables, you have to provide the key to the respective file in your elasticbeanstalk-*region*-*account*-*id* S3 bucket (created automatically):

* `AWS_S3_EB_BUCKET_CERT_KEY`: Your TLS configuration's public key
* `AWS_S3_EB_BUCKET_PRIVKEY_KEY`: Your TLS configuration's private key
* `AWS_S3_EB_BUCKET_CABUNDLE_KEY`: Your certificate authority's root and intermediate certificates
* `AWS_S3_EB_BUCKET_FIREBASECERT_KEY`: Your Firebase service account's credentials

You may then create a deployable ZIP archive using the  
`git archive --format=zip --output=archive.zip HEAD:server/app/` command.
